title: Ideas New Horizons (Game Jam)

**IDEA 1:** Something with *eggs*. The idea is that each egg stands for some "wish" or "desire". You can make them come true by, well, brooding and then popping the egg.

(And whatever comes out can help you in the rest of the puzzle.)

**IDEA 2:** A mobile game that *has* to be played in multiplayer, two people sitting opposite each other. (Like my mobile multiplayer ideas.) Something that encourages to do so with *strangers* on the bus or whatever.

**IDEA 3:** Or step away from "puzzle" or "thinky" games and just go for something silly. Maybe:

-   You need to keep a ball off the ground. ("Hooghouden" with a soccer ball.)

-   Which can of course be done single player or multiplayer.

**COMBINE IDEA 1 AND 3!**

-   You're moving very breakable, precious eggs.

-   But you have nothing to actually *hold* them, so you must keep them up.
